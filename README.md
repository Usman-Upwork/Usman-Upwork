# 👋 Hi, I'm Usman, A Senior Full‑Stack Developer

I build **production-grade systems**, not toy projects. My focus is on **scalable backend architectures, cloud infrastructure, and AI‑driven automation**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

* **Senior Full‑Stack Engineer** with a strong backend bias
* **Upwork Top Talent** with dual specializations:

  * ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps Engineering**
  * 🤖 **AI Automation & Backend Development**
* I design systems that are **observable, secure, cost‑aware, and boring to operate** (the good kind of boring)

---

## 🏢 Experience

* **Ex‑JP Morgan Chase** – Enterprise-scale systems, security, and reliability under real constraints
* **Ex‑Twitter** – High‑traffic distributed systems and performance‑critical services
* **Internships**:

  * **Amazon** – Large‑scale backend services and cloud infrastructure
  * **Datadog** – Observability, metrics, and performance tooling

---

## 🎓 Education

* **University of Texas at Austin** — Graduate
